## The Zettelkasten Method for Beginners

Now let's explore how to implement the Zettelkasten method in Obsidian to create a powerful knowledge management system.

### What is the Zettelkasten Method?

Inspired by "How to Take Smart Notes" by Sonke Ahrens, the Zettelkasten is a slip-box system that clusters ideas and connects them to create new links as you continue learning.

### Three Major Benefits

1. **Great for learning**
- Encourages slow, deliberate learning that boosts memory
- Provides instant feedback on your understanding 
- Gives freedom to connect ideas

2. **Stores and mixes ideas**
- Notes are free to mingle and connect with each other

3. **Faster and easier writing**
- Acts as a personal writing assistant

### Setting Up Your Zettelkasten

![Creating a Zettelkasten](/docs/Assets/gifs/Birth%20of%20Zettelkasten.gif)

1. Create a new vault named "The Zettelkasten"
2. Set the location to your desktop
3. Remove any clutter to start with a clean workspace

### Creating the Folder Structure

![Setting up folders](/docs/Assets/gifs/Folder%20Set%20up.gif)

Create the following six folders by right-clicking on the empty space in the left sidebar and selecting "New Folder":

1. **1 - Rough Notes**: For temporary ideas, reminders, and undeveloped thoughts
2. **2 - Source Material**: For insights from content you consume
3. **3 - Tags**: To help navigate your network of notes
4. **4 - Indexes**: For tags that have grown significantly
5. **5 - Template**: To store your notes templates
6. **6 - Main Notes**: For your primary, well-developed notes

### Setting Up Source Material Subfolders

![Creating source material subfolders](/docs/Assets/gifs/Source%20Material.gif)

Within the "2 - Source Material" folder, create subfolders to categorize your sources:
- Videos
- Readings
- (You can add more categories as needed)

### Understanding Tags and Indexes

The Tags folder helps you navigate your network of notes. When you have multiple notes related to a specific topic, you can tag them using double square brackets, like `[[TypeScript]]`.

![Moving tags to indexes](/docs/Assets/gifs/Tags%20to%20Indexes.gif)

When a tag connects to 15 or more notes, consider moving it to the Indexes folder to better organize your knowledge network.

### Setting Default Location for New Notes

![Setting default location for new notes](/docs/Assets/gifs/Default%20Location%20for%20new%20notes.gif)

1. Go to Settings
2. Select "Files & Links"
3. Under "Default location for new notes," select "6 - Main Notes"

Now all new notes you create will automatically be placed in the Main Notes folder.

### Creating a Template

![Creating a template file](/docs/Assets/gifs/create_template_file.gif)

1. Press Ctrl+O to create a new note
2. Name it "Template"
3. Drag this file to the "5 - Template" folder
4. Add the following content to your template:

```
Title: Template

Created: {{date}} {{time}}

##### Status:  #baby
<!-- Indicate how developed this note is --> 
<!-- Use #baby for basic initial thoughts --> 
<!-- Use #child for somewhat developed ideas --> 
<!-- Use #adult for well-developed concepts -->
<!-- Use #quote if this note contains direct quotes -->

##### Tags: 
<!-- Add 2-5 relevant tags that help categorize this note --> 
<!-- Use double brackets to create links: [[creativity]] [[psychology]] etc. --> 
<!-- Choose tags that aren't too broad or too specific --> 

### Main Content

<!-- Write your thoughts, analysis, and insights here -->
<!-- Focus on ONE clear idea per note --> 
<!-- Aim for clarity and brevity (under 500 words) -->
<!-- Use your own words to demonstrate understanding -->
<!-- This is where the real value of your note system lives -->


### References

<!-- Link to related notes and source materials --> 
<!-- Example: [[How creativity works]] --> 
<!-- For source materials, link to your source notes folder --> 
<!-- Example: [[2 - Source Material/Book - How to Take Smart Notes]] -->

### Connections

<!-- Describe how this note connects to other ideas --> 
<!-- This helps build your network of knowledge --> 
<!-- Example: This connects to my note on [[deliberate practice]] because... â†’
```

!!! note "Note"
    This glossary covers essential Obsidian and Zettelkasten terminology to help you navigate your note-taking journey.


## Core Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Vault** | A folder on your computer that contains all your Obsidian notes and settings. Each vault functions as a separate workspace with its own plugins, themes, and configurations. |
| **Markdown** | A lightweight markup language used to format text in Obsidian. It allows you to create headings, lists, emphasis, links, and more using simple syntax that remains readable even in plain text. |
| **Zettelkasten** | A note-taking and knowledge management method that focuses on creating atomic notes and connecting ideas through links. Developed by sociologist Niklas Luhmann, it emphasizes building a network of knowledge rather than hierarchical structures. |
| **Backlinks** | References that show which notes link to the current note. They help you discover connections between ideas and navigate your knowledge graph. |
| **MOC** | Map of Content; a note that serves as a table of contents or index for a topic. MOCs help organize related notes without enforcing rigid hierarchies. |

## Advanced Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Atomic Notes** | Self-contained notes focused on a single idea or concept, making them easier to link and reuse across your knowledge system. |
| **Bidirectional Links** | Links that create connections in both directions between notes, allowing you to navigate forward and backward through related concepts. |
| **YAML Frontmatter** | Metadata at the top of a note enclosed between `---` lines, containing properties like tags, aliases, and custom attributes. |
| **Graph View** | A visual representation of your notes and the connections between them, helping you identify clusters of related ideas and knowledge gaps. |
| **Dataview** | A popular plugin that enables database-like queries across your vault to create dynamic lists, tables, and dashboards. |

## Note Types

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Permanent Notes** | Well-developed, standalone notes that capture ideas in your own words and are designed to last in your knowledge system. |
| **Literature Notes** | Notes that capture key ideas from books, articles, or other media you consume, often linked to their source. |
| **Fleeting Notes** | Quick, temporary notes to capture ideas before they're forgotten, typically refined into permanent notes later. |
| **Daily Notes** | Journal-style notes organized by date, often used to track daily activities, thoughts, and tasks. |
| **Hub Notes** | Central notes that connect related concepts and serve as entry points to different areas of your knowledge base. |

# How to Set up Zettelkasten Part 2

## **The Zettelkasten Method for Beginners Part 2**

## Setting Default Location for New Notes

!!! note "Note"
    For this part, we want all new notes to be stored in our "6 - Main Notes" folder (our Zettelkasten). This ensures all notes are consistently stored in one place.

    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%"><iframe allow="fullscreen;autoplay" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/dud02c?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

1. Go to Settings
2. Select "Files & Links"
3. Next to "Default location for new notes," select "Vault Folder" from the dropdown
4. When 3 options appear, select "In the folder specified below"
5. In the blank field labeled "Folder to create new notes in," type "6 - Main Notes"
6. Done!

Now all new notes you create will automatically be placed in the Main Notes folder.

### Creating a Template

??? example "Expand and you will see  a pre-made template for you to use with your Zettelkasten system. Just copy and paste this on a notepad"
    
    ```
    Created: {{date}} {{time}}


    ##### Status:  #baby

    <!-- Indicate how developed this note is -->
    <!-- Use #baby for basic initial thoughts -->
    <!-- Use #child for somewhat developed ideas -->
    <!-- Use #adult for well-developed concepts -->
    <!-- Use #quote if this note contains direct quotes -->

    ##### Tags:

    <!-- Add 2-5 relevant tags that help categorize this note -->
    <!-- Use double brackets to create links: [[creativity]] [[psychology]] etc. -->
    <!-- Choose tags that aren't too broad or too specific -->

    ### Main Content

    <!-- Write your thoughts, analysis, and insights here -->
    <!-- Focus on ONE clear idea per note -->
    <!-- Aim for clarity and brevity (under 500 words) -->
    <!-- Use your own words to demonstrate understanding -->
    <!-- This is where the real value of your note system lives -->

    ### References

    <!-- Link to related notes and source materials -->
    <!-- Example: [[How creativity works]] -->
    <!-- For source materials, link to your source notes folder -->
    <!-- Example: [[2 - Source Material/Book - How to Take Smart Notes]] -->

    ### Connections

    <!-- Describe how this note connects to other ideas -->
    <!-- This helps build your network of knowledge -->
    <!-- Example: This connects to my note on [[deliberate practice]] because... -->
    ```

### Template Explanation

!!! info "About The Template above"
    I'll explain what each section of the template means. If you want to skip this explanation and just copy-paste the template, feel free to jump ahead. I will cover more in depth in *Workflow Examples*. 

The **Status** field indicates how developed your note is:
```
#baby, #child, #adult, #quote
```

- **Baby**: Basic initial thoughts

- **Child**: Somewhat developed ideas

- **Adult**: Well-developed concepts

- **Quote**: Contains direct quotes (can be paired with baby, child, or adult)

In the **Tags** section, you'll use double square brackets instead of hashtags to create links to other notes. For example, if you're learning about TypeScript types, you might tag your note with:
```
[[TypeScript]]
```

!!! tip "Tip"
    Add 2-5 relevant tags that help categorize your note. Don't make them too broad or too specific.

The **Main Content** section is where you'll write your thoughts, analysis, or insights. This can be anything from your own ideas to information you've collected from other sources. The key is to focus on one clear idea per note.

The **References** and **Connections** sections are optional but helpful for linking to other notes or citing sources.

# Obsidian Workflow using Zettelkasten

???+ example "Example"
    Let's walk through a real example of how the Zettelkasten method transforms overwhelming information into connected knowledge.


## **The Journey Begins: Method of Loci**

Imagine I encounter an unfamiliar concept: *the "Method of Loci."* My first reaction? 

*...Complete confusion.*

So I search for information and find this dense Wikipedia paragraph:

???+ example "Quote"
    "The **method of loci** is a strategy for memory enhancement, which uses visualizations of familiar spatial environments in order to enhance the recall of information. The method of loci is also known as the **memory journey**, **memory palace**, **journey method**, **memory spaces**, or **mind palace technique**. This method is a mnemonic device adopted in ancient Roman and Greek rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous _Rhetorica ad Herennium_, Cicero's _De Oratore_, and Quintilian's _Institutio Oratoria_). Many memory contest champions report using this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words."

!!! note "Note"
    In my head: *This feels overwhelming! I don't have time for this!*

## Creating My First Note

!!! success "GOOD NEWS!"
    We have a powerful tool called the *Zettelkasten* that we just made to tackle this that we already prepared from *How to Set up Zettelkasten Part 1 and 2!*

!!! tip "Tip"
    When faced with overwhelming information, break it down into atomic/chunked-out notes.

1. Press "Ctrl+O" (or "Command+O" on Mac)
2. Name the note "Method of Loci" and press Enter
3. Press "Ctrl+R" (or "Command+R" on Mac) to insert my template
4. Keep Status as #baby
5. Add the tag `[[Method of Loci]]`
6. Paste that chunky paragraph into the main content

As I read through this information, I notice an unfamiliar term: "Memory Palace." This seems important, but I don't fully understand it.

## Branching Out: Memory Palace

!!! success "A REVELATION!"
    This is where the Zettelkasten method shines - creating connected notes for deeper understanding.


1. Press Ctrl+O
2. Type "Memory Palace" and press Enter
3. Press Ctrl+R to insert my template
4. Add the tag `[[Method of Loci]]` to connect it back to my original note
5. Search online for more information

I find this helpful explanation:

???+ example "Quote"
     "**A Mind Palace (originally referred to as the Method of Loci), is a memory device used to commit a large amount of information to memory by combining visual and spatial memory. Loci is Latin for 'places', and the ancient Greeks are credited for creating this method.**"

This captures my attention! But now I'm curious about "Spatial Memory"...

## Diving Deeper: Spatial Memory

1. Press Ctrl+O
2. Type "Spatial Memory" and press Enter
3. Press Ctrl+R for my template
4. Tag it with `[[Memory Palace]]` to maintain the connection
5. Search for "Spatial Memory" online

I discover this fascinating explanation:

???+ example "Quote"
     "A complex choreography of neural activity unfolds as we navigate the world, weaving together a tapestry of spatial memories that guide our every step. This intricate dance of neurons forms the foundation of our ability to remember locations, navigate through familiar environments, and create mental maps of our surroundings. But what exactly is spatial memory, and why is it so crucial to our daily lives?

     Spatial memory is our brain's remarkable capacity to encode, store, and retrieve information about our environment and our position within it. It's the cognitive process that allows us to remember where we parked our car, find our way home from work, or locate that hidden stash of cookies in the kitchen. Without it, we'd be lost – quite literally!

      Think about your morning routine. You wake up, stumble to the bathroom, and reach for your toothbrush without even turning on the lights. That's spatial memory in action! It's not just about remembering big landmarks; it's about creating a detailed mental map of your surroundings, from the layout of your home to the streets of your city.

      But here's where it gets really interesting: this seemingly simple ability is actually the result of a complex interplay between various brain regions. It's like a well-orchestrated symphony, with different parts of the brain playing their unique roles to create a harmonious whole."

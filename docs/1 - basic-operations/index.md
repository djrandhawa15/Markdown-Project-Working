# Basic Operations 

Let's start with the basics. This section assumes you already have Obsidian installed on your device.

!!! note "First-time Users"
    If you have already played around with Obsidian after installing, you can go to the "Creating a vault" section. Otherwise, New users should click the purple "Quick start" button once you have it installed and skip the step below. 

## Creating a Vault

    </div>

A vault is a folder that contains all your notes and attachments in Obsidian.

1. Click on "Obsidian Vault" in the bottom left corner of the application
2. Select "Manage Vaults"
3. Click the purple "Create" button
4. Name your vault (e.g., "MyKnowledgeBase" or "123" from the video)
5. Click "Browse" to select a location (e.g., your desktop)
6. Click the purple "Create" button

!!! tip "Understanding Vaults"
    A vault is simply a folder on your computer that stores all your notes locally. Everything you write will be kept inside this folder as plain text markdown files, making them portable and future-proof.

## Customizing Appearance

!!! tip "Recommended Theme"
    I recommend installing the "Minimal" theme for a clean, distraction-free writing experience, but this is entirely optional. Feel free to explore other themes as well!

    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%">
    <iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/ic15vd?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
    </div>

You can customize the look and feel of Obsidian to suit your preferences:

1. Click the settings icon (gear) in the bottom left corner
2. Go to "Appearance"
3. Under "Themes," click on "Minimal"
4. Click "Install and Use"

## Changing Fonts

1. Press **Ctrl+O** (or **Cmd+O** on Mac)
2. Type a name for your note (e.g., "My First Note")
3. Press Enter
4. Start writing your content (e.g., "This is the beginning of my knowledge base")

!!! note "Keyboard Shortcut"
    The **Ctrl+O** (or **Cmd+O** on Mac) shortcut is one of the most frequently used in Obsidian. It opens the quick switcher, allowing you to quickly create or navigate to notes.

## Adding Images to Notes

???+ info "Video Tutorial: Adding Images"
    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%">
    <iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/0wwz0m?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
    </div>

Adding images to your notes is as simple as drag-and-drop:

1. Find an image file on your computer (e.g., "Lake.jpg")
2. Drag it directly into your note
3. The image will be embedded and automatically saved in your vault

!!! tip "Image Management"
    In the next sections, we'll set up automatic organization for your images to keep your vault tidy.

## Creating Folders

???+ info "Video Tutorial: Creating Folders"
    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%">
    <iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/fyaquy?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
    </div>

Organizing your notes with folders helps keep your vault tidy:

1. Right-click the empty space in the left sidebar
2. Select "New Folder" from the context menu
3. Name your new folder "Assets"
4. Click and drag your image files into the "Assets" folder

!!! warning "Folder Organization"
    While folders are useful for basic organization, we'll explore more powerful linking methods in the Zettelkasten section that go beyond traditional folder hierarchies.

## Setting Up Automatic File Organization

???+ info "Video Tutorial: Automatic File Organization"
    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%">
    <iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/o8hlsn?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
    </div>

Configure Obsidian to automatically place new attachments in your Assets folder:

1. Click the settings icon (gear) in the bottom left corner
2. Select "Files & Links" from the left sidebar
3. Find "Default location for new attachments"
4. Change the setting from "Vault folder" to "In the folder specified below"
5. Type "Assets" in the "Attachment folder path" field

!!! success "Automatic Organization"
    Now any new images or attachments you add to your notes will automatically be stored in the Assets folder, keeping your vault organized.

## Linking Images in Notes

???+ info "Video Tutorial: Linking Images"
    <div style="position:relative; width:100%; height:0px; padding-bottom:56.250%">
    <iframe allow="fullscreen" allowfullscreen height="100%" src="https://streamable.com/e/26fcgn?autoplay=1" width="100%" style="border:none; width:100%; height:100%; position:absolute; left:0px; top:0px; overflow:hidden;"></iframe>
    </div>

You can manually link to images stored in your Assets folder:

1. In your note, type an exclamation mark `!`
2. Follow it with two opening square brackets `[[`
3. Start typing the name of your image (e.g., "Lake", "Blossom", or "Waterfall")
4. Select the correct image from the autocomplete menu
5. Press Enter to insert the image

!!! example "Image Linking Syntax"
    The markdown syntax for linking an image looks like this:
    ```markdown
    ![[Lake.jpg]]
    ```

## Conclusion

!!! success "Ready for More"
    You've now learned the basic operations in Obsidian! With these fundamentals, you're ready to move on to more advanced techniques.

In the next section, we'll introduce you to the Zettelkasten method, which will transform how you manage knowledge and essentially help you build a "second brain" in Obsidian. This powerful approach will help you connect ideas and deepen your understanding of any subject.
